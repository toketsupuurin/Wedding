Toketsu Puurin presents:

Weddings (&  Friendship)
Version 1.02

Requirements: Basic Staples

A mod for Staxel.

==========

This is a mod that adds in wedding clothes, cakes, bouquets, and makes the friendship bracelet wearable. This is mostly intended for multiplayer. This adds no quests or events to the game and you can't marry any villagers. If you give the friendship bracelet to another player you won't be able to get the in game achievement for making an NPC your bestie. Male and female characters can wear any of the clothes in this mod, and it has been designed to let you keep your glasses too.

==========

Requirements:

Basic-Staples

You MUST have Basic-Staples installed for the cake crafting portion of the mod to work properly. If you just want the cute clothes then you can delete the "mods/Wedding/crafting" folder. You'll have to get the cakes from the creative menu then.

==========

On marrying NPCs/Events or quests:

NEVER going to happen. Roleplay for yourselves.

==========

On the Friendship Bracelet:

This isn't a cheat mod. You'll get the regular item from Max, so you need to have at least one NPC at full affection to get the bracelet. Put the bracelet on the combine table and activate it. It will convert to the wearable version. Repeat the process to get the giftable bracelet back to give to an NPC.

==========

On making Wedding Cakes:

Recpies can be found in the catalog. You'll need to buy some individual recipes or cookbooks from the basic staples mod to get some of the recipes you'll need to make the things. Wedding cakes are complicated and expensive! This was intended.

You'll still need to get Emilia high enough to get the carrot cake recipe. That one's not buyable.

==========

On Bouquets:

They can be thrown and your pets can fetch them.

==========

On Boutonniers and Veils:

Each of these has two different versions. The one with a comb will change your hairstyle as well as give you wedding bling.
